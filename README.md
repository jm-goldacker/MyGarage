# MyGarage

MyGarage is a tool to manage your fleet or the repairs of your service station. 

## About this project

This is my first "real" C# project and was developed around 2014 - 2015 for a small company to manage their car fleet. 
I programmed this when I was a high school student. Needless to say I would do many things different now ;)

<b>This project is not being maintained. Maybe I will refactor or rewrite the code in the future.</b>
